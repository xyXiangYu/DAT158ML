Each step is therefore carefully chosen, but we have to be able to store the entire training data set in memory. Which is often way beyond what's possible, as we often can have millions of data points. \n",

This results in pretty random updates, but has the advantage of being online: we can train the model on the fly as new data arrives. In addition, the randomness in stochastic gradient descent can allow us to escape local minimas, because a point where the cost function has derivative zero with respect to the entire data set will typically not have derivative zero when considering one point at a time.\n",
